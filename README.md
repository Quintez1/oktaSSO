<h1>Lab - Design and implement an SSO solution with Okta for a multi-application environment using OAuth and OIDC.
 </h1>
 
- Designing and implementing an SSO (Single Sign-On) solution with Okta for a multi-application environment using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) involves integrating multiple applications into a single authentication and authorization process. With Okta as the identity provider, you’ll enable users to log in once and access various applications securely.


<h1>Objective
</h1>

- Goal: Implement an SSO solution using Okta as the identity provider for multiple applications in a secure manner.

- Technologies: Okta, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC).

- Skills Covered: SSO, application integration, identity and access management, authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0 and OIDC).
  
Solution Overview
1. Okta as the Identity Provider: Okta will act as the primary identity provider to authenticate users and issue tokens for access to applications.
  
2. OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC): OAuth 2.0 will be used for authorization, while OIDC extends it for authentication, providing a secure way to handle identity.
  
3. SSO with Multiple Applications: Multiple applications, including web and mobile apps, will leverage Okta for seamless SSO, so users authenticate once and gain access to all connected applications.

<h1>Step 1: Set Up an Okta Developer Account</h1>

1. Create an Okta Developer Account:

- Go to the Okta Developer site and sign up for a free account.
  
- Once logged in, navigate to the Dashboard.
  
2. Create a New Okta Application:

- In your Okta admin console, go to Applications > Applications.

 - Click on Create App Integration and select the application type (e.g., OIDC - Web Application).

3. Define the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC Settings:

- Select OIDC - OpenID Connect as the protocol and OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow as the authentication method.

- Choose a Sign-In Redirect URI and Sign-Out Redirect URI for each app. These URLs are the locations Okta will redirect users to after sign-in or sign-out.

<h1>Step 2: Configure Applications in Okta for SSO</h1>

1. Add Applications for SSO:

- For each application in your environment (e.g., web app, mobile app), go to Applications > Applications and click Create App Integration.
  
- Select OIDC - OpenID Connect for each app and configure with the following:
  - Application Type: Select Web or Native based on the app type.
  - Login URI and Logout URI: Specify redirect URIs where Okta should redirect users post-authentication and post-logout.
  
- Assign the application to specific users or groups to control access.

2. Customize Claims in the ID Token:

- Go to Applications > Sign On > Edit OpenID Connect ID Token.

- Add or modify claims such as name, email, role, or other custom attributes needed by your applications. These claims will be sent as part of the ID token.

<h1>Step 3: Enable OAuth 2.0 and OIDC for Authorization and Authentication</h1>

1. Generate Client ID and Client Secret:

- When setting up each app, Okta will generate a Client ID and Client Secret for each application. These values uniquely identify each app and must be securely stored.

2. Define Authorization Server Settings:

- Okta provides a default authorization server for your applications. Go to Security > API > Authorization Servers.

- Configure Authorization Policies based on user roles, IP address, or other conditions to control access.

3. Configure Scopes:

- Scopes define the access your application is requesting. Common OIDC scopes include openid, profile, and email.

- Define custom scopes if specific permissions are required (e.g., read:data, write:data).

<h1>Step 4: Implement SSO in Your Applications</h1>

Now, set up each application to handle SSO by integrating with Okta’s OAuth 2.0 and OIDC endpoints.

4.1: Integrate a Web Application

1. Configure Okta SDK or Library:

- Use the Okta OIDC SDK or a library like Auth.js (for JavaScript) or Okta JWT Verifier for backend verification.
Redirect to Okta for Authentication:

2. Redirect users to Okta’s Authorization Endpoint using Bash:

https://{YourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize

- Include the following parameters:

client_id: Your application’s client ID from Okta.

redirect_uri: Your app’s callback URL.

response_type: Typically set to code for Authorization Code Flow.

scope: Scopes required for your app (e.g., openid profile email).

state: Optional, but recommended for maintaining request state.

3. Handle Authorization Code and Obtain Tokens:

- After a successful login, Okta will redirect the user to your app’s redirect_uri with an authorization code.

- Use the authorization code to request an ID Token and Access Token from Okta’s Token Endpoint using Bash:

https://{YourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token
Verify ID Token and Access Token:

Decode and verify the ID Token to authenticate the user.
Use the Access Token to authorize access to your API or other resources.
4.2: Integrate a Mobile Application
For mobile apps, use the Authorization Code with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) flow for enhanced security.

Redirect to Okta for Authentication:

Use the Okta OIDC SDK for mobile (iOS, Android) to manage the OAuth flow.
Mobile apps will follow a similar redirect-based flow, where Okta handles authentication and authorization.
PKCE for Enhanced Security:

PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) adds security by preventing interception of authorization codes.
Generate a code verifier and code challenge to append to your request to Okta.
Step 5: Test SSO Flow Across Applications
Initiate SSO:

Visit one application and log in using Okta. After a successful login, the application should redirect the user back to the specified URI.
Access Additional Applications:

After logging in to the first application, visit a second application integrated with Okta.
Since SSO is enabled, Okta should recognize the user’s session and provide seamless access to the second application without requiring a re-login.
Step 6: Implement Access Control and Permissions
Use scopes and claims to control access levels within applications.

Define Roles and Permissions in Okta:

Go to Directory > Groups in Okta to create groups like admin, user, etc.
Assign users to these groups based on their roles.
Configure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

In each application, use claims within the ID Token to enforce role-based access.
For example, if a user’s token includes role: admin, grant access to administrative sections of the app.
Step 7: Set Up Security and Monitoring
7.1: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Go to Security > Multifactor in Okta.
Enable factors like SMS, Authenticator App, or Push Notification to add an extra layer of security.
7.2: Enable Activity Monitoring and Logging
Go to Reports > System Log to monitor login attempts, failed logins, and other activity.
Enable alerts to notify administrators of suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts.
7.3: Regular Token Audits
Regularly review issued tokens for unusual activity, like long-lasting tokens or high-frequency requests.
Step 8: Document and Test the SSO Solution
Document the Setup:

Write detailed documentation on the setup process, SSO flow, and how each app integrates with Okta.
Include details about OAuth scopes, claims, and how roles map to application permissions.
Perform End-to-End Testing:

Test the SSO flow across all integrated applications, ensuring users can seamlessly access multiple applications without re-authenticating.
Test different scenarios, including:
New user sign-up and first-time login.
Session expiration and re-login.
Access restriction based on user role.
Project Outcomes
By the end of this project, you will have:

Set up an SSO solution with Okta as the identity provider.
Integrated multiple applications using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for secure authentication and authorization.
Configured roles, permissions, and access control using claims in ID tokens.
Secured the solution with MFA and implemented monitoring and alerts for security.
This solution is scalable and secure, suitable for enterprises that need centralized identity management and seamless access across multiple applications.
